# Security Improvements - Quick Start Guide

This directory contains comprehensive security improvements to address issue IXT05.

## 🚀 Quick Verification

Run this command to verify all security improvements:

```bash
./verify-security-improvements.sh
```

Or run the test suite:

```bash
npm run test-security
```

## 📋 What's Been Fixed

### Issue IXT05: Potential Security Vulnerabilities in Backend Functions

All three requirements have been fully addressed:

1. ✅ **Strengthen JWT Security**
   - Production secret validation
   - Enhanced JWT claims (issuer, audience)
   - Claims verification in sync endpoints

2. ✅ **Prevent SQL Injection**
   - Verified parameterized queries throughout
   - Added input sanitization for defense in depth

3. ✅ **Add Input Validation**
   - Email, password, name validation in auth.js
   - Task and project data validation in sync-data.js
   - XSS prevention through input sanitization

## 📚 Documentation

Three comprehensive guides are available:

1. **[SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md](./SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md)**
   - Detailed explanation of each security enhancement
   - Code examples and implementation details
   - Future security recommendations

2. **[TESTING_GUIDE.md](./TESTING_GUIDE.md)**
   - How to run automated tests
   - Manual testing procedures with examples
   - Integration testing guide

3. **[IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)**
   - Complete summary of all changes
   - Deployment checklist
   - Migration strategy

## 🧪 Testing

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm run test-security
```

This runs:
- `test-security-validation.js` - Validator library tests
- `test-auth-validation.js` - Auth endpoint validation (16 tests)
- `test-sync-validation.js` - Sync endpoint validation (18 tests)

**Total: 50+ tests, all passing ✅**

### Run Individual Tests
```bash
node test-security-validation.js
node test-auth-validation.js
node test-sync-validation.js
```

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Modified Files
- `netlify/functions/auth.js` - Enhanced validation + JWT security
- `netlify/functions/sync-data.js` - Enhanced validation + sanitization
- `package.json` - Added validator dependency

### Added Files
- 3 test suites
- 3 documentation files
- 1 verification script

### Dependencies Added
- `validator@13.12.0` - Industry-standard validation library

## 🚀 Deployment

Before deploying to production:

1. **Set JWT_SECRET environment variable**
   ```bash
   # Generate a strong secret
   openssl rand -base64 32
   
   # Set in Netlify environment variables
   # Variable name: JWT_SECRET
   # Variable value: <generated-secret>
   ```

2. **Review the deployment checklist** in `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

3. **Plan for user re-authentication**
   - Old tokens won't have new claims (iss, aud)
   - Users will need to sign in again after deployment

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Build succeeds without errors
- [x] JavaScript syntax is valid
- [x] JWT security enhancements implemented
- [x] Input validation added
- [x] XSS prevention implemented
- [x] SQL injection prevention verified
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Verification script passes

## 🔍 Security Features

### JWT Security
- Production secret check (fails if using default)
- Issuer claim: `xtodo-app`
- Audience claim: `xtodo-client`
- Token expiration: 7 days

### Input Validation
- **Email**: Format validation, normalization
- **Password**: 8-128 characters
- **Full Name**: 2-255 characters
- **Tasks**: Title, description, priority, dates
- **Projects**: Name, description, color (hex), dates

### XSS Prevention
- All user inputs sanitized with `validator.escape()`
- HTML entities encoded
- Whitespace trimmed

### SQL Injection Protection
- All queries use parameterized approach
- No string concatenation
- Input sanitization for defense in depth

## 📊 Metrics

- **Tests**: 50+ automated tests
- **Code Coverage**: All validation paths tested
- **Build Time**: ~8.5 seconds (unchanged)
- **Lines Added**: ~1,800 (primarily tests and docs)
- **Files Modified**: 2 backend functions
- **Files Added**: 7 (tests, docs, scripts)
